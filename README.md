## 📚 Overview
This project replicates part of Netflix’s search experience by randomly suggesting shows based on the selected genre.  
Users can choose "Drama", "Fantasy", "Comedy", or "Random" to discover a show.

This simulates working in a modular team where developers build specific functions fitting into a larger project.
